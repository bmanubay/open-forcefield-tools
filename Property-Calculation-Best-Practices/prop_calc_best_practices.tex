{\large Best Practices for Property Prediction from Molecular Simulations}

\section{Preliminaries}
Definitions
\begin{itemize}
\item $V$: Volume
\item $U$: Total energy (including potential and kinetic, excluding external energy such as due to gravity, etc)
\item $S$: Entopy
\item $N$: Number of particles
\item $T$: Temperature
\item $P$: Pressure
\item $k_B$: Boltzmann constant
\item $\beta$: $(k_B T)^{-1}$
\item $M$: Molar mass
\item $\rho$: Density ($M/V$)
\item $H$: Enthalpy 
\item $G$: Gibbs Free Energy (free enthalpy)
\item $A$: Helmholtz Free Energy
\item $\mu$: Chemical potential
\item $u$: reduced energy
\item $f$: reduced free energy
\end{itemize}
Macroscopically, the quantities $V$, $U$, $N$ are constants (assuming
the system is not perturbed in any way), as we assume that the
fluctuations are essentially zero, and any uncertainty comes from our
inability to measure that constant precisly. For a mole of compound
(about 18 mL for water), the relative uncertainty in any of these
quantites is about $10^{-12}$, far lower than any thermodynamics
experiment.

However, in a molecular simulation, these quantites are not
necessarily constant. For example, in a $NVT$ simulation, $U$ is
allowed to vary.  For a long enough simulation (assuming ergodicity,
which can pretty much always be assumed with correct simulations and
simple fluids), then the ensemble average value of $U$ = $\langle U
\rangle$ will be constant, and in the limit of large simulations/long
time will converge to the macroscopic value $U$; at least, the
macroscopic value of that given model, though perhaps not the $U$ for
the real system..  In an $NVT$ simulation, clearly $V$ is constant.
In a NPT simulation, however, $V$ is a variable, and we must estimate
what the macroscopic value would be with the ensemble estimate
$\langle V \rangle$.

The quantities $T$, $P$, and $\mu$ are {\em always} constants in both
simulation in experiment.  There are a number of quantities that can
be used to ESTIMATE these constants. For example, $\langle
\frac{1}{3Nk_B}\sum_i m_i |v_i|^2\rangle$, where $m$ is the mass of each
particle and $|v_i|$ is the magnitude of the velocity of each
particle, is an estimator of $T$, and it's average will be equal to
the temperature. But it is not the temperature. This quantity
fluctuates, but the tempature remains constant; otherwise the
simulation could not be at constant temperature.

Ensemble averages of some quantity $X$ ($\langle X \rangle$) are
assumed to be averages over the appropriate Boltzmann weighting,
i.e. in the $NVT$ ensemble with classical statistical mechanics, they
would be $\int X(\vec{x},\vec{p}) e^{-\beta U(\vec{x},\vec{p})} d\vec{x}d\vec{p}$. We
note that in the limit of very large systems, $\langle X \rangle_{NPT}
= \langle X \rangle_{NVT} = \langle X \rangle_{\mu VT}$.

Ensemble averages can be computed by one of two ways. First, they can
be computed directly, by running a simulation that produces samples
with the desired Boltzmann distribution.  In that case ensemble
averages can be computed as simple averages, $\langle V \rangle =
\frac{1}{N}\sum_i V_i$, where the sum is over all observations.
Uncertainties can be estimated in a number of different ways, but
usually require estimating the number of uncorrelated
samples. Secondly, they can be calculated as reweighted estimates from
several different simulations, as $\langle V \rangle$ =
$\frac{1}{\sum_i w_i} V_i w_i$ where $w_i$ is a reweighting factor
that can be derived from importance sampling theory. 

To simplify our discussion of reweighting, we use some additional
notation.  We define the reduced potential $u = \beta U(\vec{x})$ in
the canonical (NVT) ensemble, $u = \beta U + \beta PV$ in the
isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble, and $u = \beta U - \beta N\mu$ in
the grand canonical ensemble (similar potentials can be defined in
other ensembles). We then define $f = \int e^{-u} dx$, where the
integral is over all of the DOF of the system ($x$ for NVT, $x,V$ for
NPT, and $x,N$ for.  For NPT, we then have $f = \beta G$, and for NVT
we have $f = \beta A$, while for $\mu V T$ we have $f = -\beta \langle
P \rangle V$.

To calculate expectations at one set of parameters generated with
paramters that give rise to a different set of probability
distributions, we start with the definition of an ensemble average
given a probability distribution $p_i(x)$. 
\begin{equation}
\langle X \rangle_i = \int X(x) p_i(x) dx 
\end{equation}
We then multiply and divide by $p_j(x)$, to get
\begin{equation}
\langle X \rangle_i = \int X(x) p_i(x) \frac{p_j(x)}{p_j(x)}dx = \int X(x) p_j(x) \frac{p_i(x)}{p_j(x)}dx 
\end{equation}
We then note that this last integral can be estimated by the Monte Carlo estimate
\begin{equation}
\langle X \rangle_i = \int X(x) p_j(x) \frac{p_i(x)}{p_j(x)}dx = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N X(x_n) \frac{p_i(x_n)}{p_j(x_n)}
\end{equation}
Where the $x_k$ are sampled from probability distribution $p_j(x)$

We now define the mixture distribution of $K$ other distributions as:
$p_m(x) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N N_k p_k(x)$, where $N = \sum_k
N_k$.  We can construct a sample from the mixture distribution by
simply pooling all the samples from $k$ individual simulations.
The formula for calculating ensemble averages in a distribution $p_i(x)$
from samples from the mixture distribution is:
\begin{equation}
\langle X \rangle_i = \sum_{n=1}^N X(x_n) \frac{p_i(x_n)}{\sum{k=1}^{N_k} p_k(x_n)}
\end{equation}
In the case of Boltzmann averages, then $p_i(x) = e^{f_i-u_i(x)}$, where
the reduced free energy $f$ is unknown.  Reweighting from the mixture
distibution becomes.
\begin{equation}
\langle X \rangle_i = \sum_{n=1}^N X(x_n) \frac{e^{f_i - u_i(x_n)}}{\sum_{k=1}^{N_k} e^{f_k - u_k(x)}}
\end{equation}
which can be seen to be the same formula as the MBAR formula for
expectations. The free energies can be obtained by setting X=1, and
looking at the $K$ equations obtained by reweighting to the $K$
different distributions. 

Finite differences at different temperatures and pressures can be
calculated by including states with different reduced potentials. For
example, $u_j(x) = \beta_i U(x) + \beta_i (P_i + \Delta P) V$, or $u_j
= \frac{1}{k_B(T_i + \Delta T)} U(x) + \frac{1}{k_B(T_i + \Delta T)}
P_i V$. However, the relationship between $f$ and $G$ can be
problematic when looking at differences in free energy with respect to
temperature, because $G_2 - G_1 = \beta_2 f_2 - \beta_1 f_1$.  
[MRS: needs to find notes on how this was dealt with last time]

Since with MBAR, one can make the differences as small as one would
like (you don't have to actually carry out a simulation at those
points), we can use the simplest formulas: central difference for first derivatives: 
\[\frac{dA}{dx} \approx \frac{1}{2\Delta x}\left( A(x+\Delta x) - A(x-\Delta x)\right)\]
And for 2nd deriatives:
\[\frac{d^2A}{dx^2} \approx \frac{1}{\Delta x^2}\left( A(x+\Delta x) - 2A(x) + A(x-\Delta x)\right)\]
Thus, only properties at two additional points need to be evaluated to
calculate both first and 2nd derivatives.

Note that if the finite differences are reevaluated using reweighting
approaches, it is important that the simulation used generates the
correct Boltzmann distribution. If not, reweighted observables will be
incorrect, and the results of the finite difference approach will have
significant error.

%MRS: I removed noindent -- better to fix formatting by changing the latex definitions, not by adding a bunch of exceptions.

\section{Pure Solvent Properties}
\subsection{Density}
\subsubsection{Direct calculation}
%MRS: Experimentally, <V> is just the macroscopic V.
 Starting with the equation used to calculate the density experimentally, 
\begin{equation} \rho = \frac{M}{V} \end{equation}
We replace the average with the esemble estimate (calculated either directly, or with reweighting) to obtain: 
\begin{equation} \rho = \frac{M}{\langle V \rangle} \end{equation}
\subsubsection{Derivative Estimate}
 From the differential definition of the Gibbs free energy $dG = VdP -SdT + \sum_i \mu_i dN_i$ that V can be calculated from the Gibbs free energy as:
\begin{equation} V = \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial P} \right)_{T,N} \end{equation}
 The density can therefore be estimated from the Gibbs free energy.
\begin{equation} \rho = \frac{M}{ \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial P} \right)_{T,N}} \end{equation}
 The derivative can be estimated using a central difference numerical method utilizing Gibbs free energies reweighted to different pressures.
\begin{equation} \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial P} \right)_{T,N} \approx \frac{G_{P + \Delta P} - G_{P-\Delta P}}{2\Delta p} \end{equation}
 The density can then finally be estimated.
%MRS: I changed a lot of the lower case p's for pressure to upper case P's to use more standard symbols -- you should review and correct the rest.
\begin{equation} \rho \approx \frac{M}{\frac{G_{P + \Delta P} - G_{P-\Delta P}}{2\Delta P}} \end{equation}
This can be calculated from the reduced free energy $f$ if desired by simply substituting:
\begin{equation} \rho \approx \frac{\beta M}{\frac{f_{p + \Delta p} - f_{p-\Delta p}}{2\Delta p}} \end{equation}

\subsection{Isothermal Compressibility}
 The definition of isothermal compressibility is:
\begin{equation}\kappa_T = -\frac{1}{V} \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T \end{equation}
\subsubsection{First Derivative}
Thus, it can be estimated by the finite difference of $\langle V \rangle$
\begin{equation}\kappa_T = -\frac{1}{2V(T,P)^2} \left(\langle V(P+\Delta P,T)\rangle - \langle V(P-\Delta P)\right\rangle) \end{equation}
Or by the finite differences evaluation of:
\begin{equation}\kappa_T = -\frac{\left(\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial P^2}\right)_{T, N}}{\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial P}\right)_{T, N}}\end{equation}\\*

 $\kappa_T$ can also be estimated from the ensemble average and fluctuation of volume (in the NPT ensemble) or particle number (in the $\mu$VT ensemble)\cite{comp}:
\begin{equation}\kappa_T = \beta \frac{\langle \Delta V^2 \rangle_{NTP}}{\langle V \rangle_{NTP}} = V \beta \frac{\langle \Delta N^2 \rangle_{VT}}{\langle N \rangle_{VT}}\end{equation}\\*


\subsection{Molar Enthalpy}
 Section on relation of enthalpy to Gibbs free energy (should we need it).
 The enthalpy, $H$, can be found from the Gibbs free energy, $G$, by the Gibbs-Helmholtz relation: 

\begin{equation}H=-T^2 \left(\frac{\partial \big(\frac{G}{T}\big)}{\partial T}\right)_{P,N}\end{equation}

 Transforming the derivative in the Gibbs-Helmholtz relation to be in terms of $\beta$ instead of $T$ yields:

\begin{equation}H=-T^2  \frac{\beta^2}{\beta^2}\left(\frac{\partial \big(\frac{G}{T}\big)}{\partial T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \beta} \frac{\partial \beta}{\partial T}\right)_{P,N}\end{equation}


 Recall that $\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T}$, therefore $\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial T} = - \frac{1}{k_B T^2}$. Substituting these values into the enthalpy equation gives:

%MRS: usually, you should just use \left( instead of \big(, since it will choose the correct size for you! 
\begin{equation}H = \frac{1}{k_B^3 T^2 \beta^2} \left(\frac{\partial \big(\frac{G}{T}\big)}{\partial \beta}\right)_{P,N} = \frac{1}{k_B} \left(\frac{\partial \big(\frac{G}{T}\big)}{\beta}\right)_{P,N} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial \beta}_{T, P,N} \end{equation}
%MRS: I like this equation more, as it's hard to take finite differences of $G$ (as discussed above).  Then you can eliminate the last few lines.

%MRS: Also, not clear it should go here because molar enthalpy isn't an experimental measurement.  OR explicitly mention it isn't an experimental quantity, BUT you need it for other quantites (like the enthalpy of mixing, and the heat capacity).

 Applying the quotient rule to the partial derivative yields


\begin{equation}H = \frac{T}{k_B} \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial \beta}\right)_{P, N} - \frac{G}{k_B}\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \beta}\right)_{P, N} = \frac{1}{T k_B} \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial \beta}\right) - \frac{G}{T^2 k_B} \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \beta}\right)\end{equation}


 Recall that $\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \beta}\right)_{P, N} = -k_B T^2$, which allows the enthalpy to be simplified to:


\begin{equation} H = \beta \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial \beta}\right)_{P, N} + G\end{equation}


 The derivative can be estimated using a central difference numerical method utilizing Gibbs free energies reweighted to different temperatures.

\begin{equation} \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial \beta} \right)_{P,N} \approx \frac{G_{\beta + \Delta \beta} - G_{\beta -\Delta \beta}}{2\Delta \beta} \end{equation}

\subsection{Heat Capacity}
 The definition of the isobaric heat capacity is:
\begin{equation}C_P =\left( \frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_{P,N}\end{equation}
%MRS: probably easier to take df/dbeta, and then take the temperature derivaive, which can be converted into a second beta derivative by a change of variable, so it's a 2nd derivative of f WRT beta, with some prefactors of beta.
\begin{equation}C_P =  -k_B \beta^3 \left(\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial \beta^2}\right)_{P,N}\end{equation}\\*


 Finite difference approach? See section on Molar Enthalpy\\*

 The form is equivalent for isochoric heat capacity, but with derivatives at constant volume rather than pressure.

\subsection{Speed of Sound}
%MRS: did you lose the square root?
 The definition of the speed of sound is\cite{sos}:
\begin{equation}c^2 = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho}\right)_{S}} = -\frac{V^2}{M}\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_{S}\end{equation}

%MRS: I'd make the derivation more explicit, breakin down (dP/dV)_S -> in terms of the triple product rule, and then expressing it a a function of explicit deriatives, so it's clear what evaluations would be needed. 
\begin{equation}c^2 = \frac{V^2}{\beta M}\left[\frac{\left(\frac{\gamma_V}{k_B}\right)^2}{\frac{C_V}{k_B}} + \frac{\beta}{V \kappa_T}\right]\end{equation}\\*

 Where:\\*
\begin{equation}\gamma_V = \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_{V} = \frac{C_V}{T \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial P}\right)_{V}}\end{equation}\\*

 $\gamma_V$ is known as the isochoric pressure coefficient. $\kappa_T$ is the same isothermal compressibility from section A.1.3\\*


\subsection{Enthalpy of Vaporization}
%MRS: should look at Horne et al (mentioned by Fennell), the original TIP4P-ew
%water paper, to see some of the corrections one can add. Usually,
%these are corrections involving phase changes, but there are a few
%others you should check out.

 The definition of the enthalpy of vaporization is\cite{hvap}:
\begin{equation}\Delta H_{vap} = H_{gas} - H_{liq} = E_{gas} - E_{liq} + P(V_{gas} - V_{liq})\end{equation}\\*

 If we assume that $V_{gas} >> V_{liq}$ and that the gas is ideal 
%MRS: the gas being ideal means the kinetic energy terms cancel, not that they can be neglected. The intramolecular interactions are assumed to be nelected.
(and can therefore neglect kinetic energy terms):
\begin{equation}\Delta H_{vap} = E_{gas, potential} - E_{liq, potential} + R T\end{equation}\\*

%MRS: made a complete sentence (plus added some detail)
This is frequently done as a single simulation calculation by assuming
the average intramolecular energies remains constant during the phase
change, which is rigorously correct for something like a rigid water
molecule (intramolecular energies are zero), but less true for
something with structural rearrangement between gas and liquid phases. 

%MRS: Moved this section down, derivation and details were unlike.
%MRS: I'm not as much an expert on this: you should follow up.  Also,
%probably use something other than $M$ as the dipole.
\subsubsection{Dielectric Constant}
 This equation was provided by a literature reference authored by CJ Fennell\cite{dielec}. Below, $\epsilon(0)$ is the zero frequency dielectric constant, $V$ is the system volume and $M$ is the total system dipole moment. 
\begin{equation} \epsilon(0) = 1 + \frac{4 \pi}{3 k_B T \langle V \rangle}(\langle M^2 \rangle - \langle M \rangle^2) \end{equation}



\section{Binary Mixture Properties} 
\subsection{Mass Density, Speed of Sound and Dielectric Constant}
 The methods for these calculations are the same for a multicomponent system.

\subsubsection{Activity Coefficient}
The definition of chemical potential in a pure substance is:
\begin{equation}\mu(T,P) = \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial N}\right)_{T,P}\end{equation}
which is a function of only temperaure and pressure.

Then the definition of the chemical potential $\mu_i$ of compound $i$ in a mixture is:
\begin{equation}\mu_{i}(T,P,\vec{N}) = \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial N_{i}}\right)_{T,P,N_{j \neq i}}\end{equation}\\*
$N_i$ refers to a molecule of component $i$ and $N_{j \neq i}$ refers
to all molecules other than component $i$, with $\vec{N}$ the vector
of all component numbers. Since $\mu_i$ is intensive, this is
equivalently a function of the vector of mole fractions $\vec{x}_i$ instead of simply of $N_i$.\\*

For an ideal solution, the chemical potential $\mu_i$ can be related to the pure chemical potential by 
\begin{equation}\mu_{i}(T,P,\vec{x}_i) = \mu(T,P) + k_B T \ln\left(\gamma_i\right)\end{equation}\\*

By analogy to this form, we can 
\begin{equation}\mu_{i}(T,P,\vec{x}_i) = \mu(T,P) + k_B T \ln\left(x_i \gamma_i\right)\end{equation}\\*

Where $\gamma_i$ is the activity coefficient of component $i$, and is
a function of $T$,$P$,and $\vec{x}_i$.  Rearrangement of the previous
equation yields:
\begin{equation}\gamma_i = \frac{e^{\left(\frac{\mu_i(T,P,\vec{x}_i) - \mu(T,P)}{k_B T}\right)}}{x_i}\end{equation}\\*

Although chemical potentials cannot be directly calculated from
simulation, chemical potential differences can. We can calculate the
difference $\mu_i(T,P,\vec{x}_i) - \mu(T,P)$ by calculating $\Delta
\mu(T,P)_{liquid} - \Delta \mu(T,P)_{gas}$ using a standard alchemical
simulation of the pure substance, followed by the calculation of
$\mu_i(T,P,\vec{x}_i)_{liquid} - \Delta \mu(T,P,\vec{x}_i)_{gas}$, and
assuming that $\Delta \mu(T,P,\vec{x}_i)_{gas} = \Delta
\mu(T,P)_{gas}$ (note: there are a few subleties here relating to the
$\ln x_i$ factor, but it appears that with alchemical simulations with
a only one particle that is allowed to change, this will cancel out
(need to follow up).


\subsubsection{Excess Molar Properties}
 The general definition of an excess molar property can be stated as follows:
\begin{equation}y^{E} = y^{M} - \sum_{i} x_i y_i\end{equation}\\*

 Where $y^E$ is the excess molar quantity, $y^M$ is the mixture quantity, $x_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$ in the mixture and $y_i$ is the pure solvent quantity. In general, the simplest methods for calculating excess molar properties for binary mixtures will require three simulations. One simulation is run for each pure component and a third will be run for the specific mixture of interest.
We note that only one set of pure simulations are needed to calculate excess properties at all compositions.

\subsubsection{Excess Molar Heat Capacity and Volume}
 Excess molar heat capacities and volume will be calculated using the  methods for the pure quantities in section $A.1$ in combination with the general method for excess property calculation above.\\*

\subsubsection{Excess Molar Enthalpy}
 Excess molar enthalpy can be calculated using the general relation of molar enthalpy as it relates to Gibbs Free Energy from section $A.1$ and the generalized method of ecess molar property calculation above or by the following\cite{hexcess}:
\begin{equation}H^E = \langle E^M \rangle + P V^E - \sum_{i} x_i \langle E_i \rangle\end{equation}\\*

 Where $\langle \rangle$ denotes an ensemble average and $V^E$ is calculated using the general method of excess molar properties.\\*
