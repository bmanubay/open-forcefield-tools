# Various random examples 

## Manifest:
- param_sampling: Ipython notebooks relating to some simple tests of how parameter sampling could work
- substructure_linking.ipynb: Example of how one can use SMIRKS patterns to generate a library of molecules containing certain fragments. This will likely be helpful later in generating libraries of molecules that contain specific SMIRKS patterns, such as for QM reference calculations for forcefield parameterization.
